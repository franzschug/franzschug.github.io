<p style="color:#072B6B;"><b><u> Introduction </u></b></p>

<p style="color:#072B6B;"> Fast urbanization as a constantly ongoing rapid process leads to the further spread of megacities like Mexico City. Even though the capital of Mexico has registered a slower population growth over the last 20 years, its urban area continues to expand (Aguilar, 2008).
There are different reasons for population growth in big cities. There is an overlay of the growing urban population itself and new migration into the city. In this regard globalization plays a major role in making cities more appealing, because of the relocation of production sites for instance (Kraas 2016). 
Monitoring processes such as rapid urbanization are of high importance in order to draw conclusions about the social, economic and ecological effects. For example, it causes a drastic loss of biodiversity (Pauchard, 2006), traffic and water are a growing problem for the population (URBANNET, 2019) and megacities often suffer from high emissions and socioeconomic disparities (Kraas 2016). Mexico City is challenged, like many other mega cities, with high air pollution (McNeill &amp; Engelke 2014).
Since Mexico City is considered one of the most known examples of rapid urbanization, much research has been done on this topic. Nevertheless, it is important to monitor current developments with high resolution data because of the constantly changing process. The goal of this project is to create binary maps that show the changes in the urban expansion of Mexico City to provide up-to-date data.</p>

<br>
<p style="color:#072B6B;"><b><u> Research question </u></b></p>

<ul style="color:#072B6B;"><li>How has Mexico City expanded in the last nineteen years (2000 - 2019)?</li>
<li> How can you rate this change?</li></ul> 

<br>
<p style="color:#072B6B;"><b><u> Methodology </u></b></p>

<p style="color:#072B6B;">In this study we used Landsat data from 2000 and 2019 covering the area of Mexico City. Satellite images from December were used in both years because of the low cloud coverage in that time of the year. To ensure a good classification around 2000 training pixels were independently selected – 1100 urban pixels and around 900 non-urban pixels. In addition to that 300 randomly created validation points were assigned to the different classes in order to determine the accuracy of the classification later. Afterwards a random forest classifier with 200 trees was performed and the change map created. The few pixels with the class &apos;urban to non-urban&apos; were reclassified as &apos;urban to urban&apos; because of the unlikelihood of an urban area turning back. The validation data was then used to review the accuracy. As a last step the pixel number for each class was calculated in order to compute the total area of change.<br>
QGIS and its plug-in EnMapBox were used for the analysis.</p>

<table style="width:70%">
  <tr>
    <th>Legend</th>
    <th>Colour</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>urban -&gt; urban</td>
    <td bgcolor=#701D1E></td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>non urban -&gt; urban</td>
    <td bgcolor=#ED9685></td>

  </tr>

<p style="color:#072B6B;">The urban area around Mexico City is constantly growing. That is why it does not make sense to define a fixed city boundary and analyze only within that area. Therefore the wider area of Mexico City was considered. <br>

Within the selected area the urban area increase by about 51 percent between 2000 and 2019. The urban area grew from about 1260 km² in 2000 to about 1900 km² in 2019. The biggest growth area wise was in the North and East. <br>
This method is not useful to estimate the density of housing. It is only possible to determine whether or not a pixel is urban or non-urban. If you want to assess the density of each pixel it is recommended to combine this approach with other methods. <br> <br>

The results have an Overall Accuracy of 86.67 percent. <br>
The Producer’s and User’s Accuracy of the classes are as follows:</p>
