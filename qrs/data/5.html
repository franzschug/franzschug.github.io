<h4 class="title">Abstract</h4>
<p>
Urban expansion is a global phenomenon, especially in South-East Asia. Land reclamation is an often used procedure for small coastal countries, such as Singapore. This study project aims to look at the expansion of Singapore, which is also known for its rapid expansion in the past decades. For that we will make a change detection of land cover and on land use using Landsat Data for the years 2009 and 2019.                   
</p>
			
<h4 class="title">Introduction</h4>
<p>
Today more than half of the global population lives in cities, which place a higher requirement on urban planners. The challenge could be how to expand the city to satisfy the residents' growth. For city-states, it is even harder to deal with said problem due to limited space. Some of the asian cities deal with that problem by using land reclamation (Glaser et. al., 1991). One of the successful models is Singapore.
Singapore is located in South-East Asia and belongs to the Asian Tiger States, a state that is rising upwards economically. After their independence in 1965 from Malaysia the urban area and the population grew rapidly. The growing industry and the growing population needed space, so the government started to reclaim land off the coast. By 1991 10% of Singapore’s land was reclaimed (Glaser et. al., 1991). Another adopted concept was spatial urban planning. It was no longer limited to sectoral approaches, like housing or industrial zones, but integrated in a multidimensional territorial development (Wong et. al., 2008). In 2008, Singapore’s overall land mass consisted of 22% reclaimed land (Wong et. al., 2008). At the Singapore Conference 2015 in London, the former prime minister of Singapore, Goh Chok Tong, stated that the country is planning to expand their land mass by another 7-8% by the year 2030.
When looking at the existing literature, there is only the long-term development of Singapore depicted and analysed, but not the recent development. Singapore is still growing and is still experiencing a population growth. Therefore we will be looking at the land development of the country of the past 10 years.                   
</p>

<h4 class="title">Research Goal and questions</h4>
<p>
Our study aims to map the land changes in Singapore between 2009 and 2019.
Specifically we addressed two questions: First, how did the land-cover and -use in Singapore change between 2009 and 2019? Second, how much did the city areas grow in this ten-year period?                 
</p>


<h4 class="title">Methods</h4>
<p>
The remotely sensed images were already pre-processed under consideration of the heavy cloud cover in Singapore throughout the whole year. The used data was the cloud-free images computed from Landsat (4,5,7,8) imagery from 2008/2009 and 2018/2019.

<p>
Random forest algorithm was adopted to sort the pre-processed Landsat images into four land-use and -cover classes. The study employed the stratified random sampling tool in QGIS to select 50 validation points for accuracy assessment. If the accuracy rate is lower than 85% (Anderson et al., 1976), which indicates an unsatisfied classification result, the amount of training samples would increase to repeat the classification process. For the final supervised classification results, 231 and 105 training samples were manually selected and applied respectively for 2009 and 2019.
Following the classification of images, change-detection algorithms were used to determine changes.               
</p>


<h4 class="title">Results</h4>
<p>
The overall accuracy of classification results in 2009 and 2019 is over 87%. The result of change-detection was reclassified and mapped based on the changed types into 7 classes, namely stable water, stable vegetation, stable barren, stable urban, land extension, urban extension, and other changes. The land extension class was colored in red, displaying all changes from water to other land types. The urban extension in orange shows all areas changed from other land-cover and -use to urban built-up.
From the detection map, the land expansion (appro. 4146 hectares) especially the reclamation on the eastern and western edge of Singapore island is notable. A significant land extension is shown on the previous ocean areas. Degradation of vegetation cover is found in these 10-year’s changes. Artificial buildings were built on forest and grassland in 2009. Part of the vegetation lands changed into barren. Total urban extension is about 111676 hectares.
