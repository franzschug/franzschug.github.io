                <h4 class="title">Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                The population of sub-Saharan Africa is projected to double by 2050 (99%). 
            	Ethiopia is among the nine countries that will make up more than 
            	half the projected population growth between 2019 and 2050 (United
            	Nations, 2019). The capital city Addis Ababa  has experienced significant 
            	changes in land cover in recent history. 
            	Most importantly, the capital city of Ethiopia 
            	has increased in area extent due to the pressure of population increase.
            	Through analyzing the changes in land cover  fractions over time we aimed to 
				characterize the surface dynamics of Addis Ababa since 1985, in 
				particular the urban expansion process with regards to urban area and 
				structure density. Furthermore, our goal was to relate the suspected area 
				increase with the population increase of Addis Ababa.               
                </p>
                
                <h4 class="title">Methods</h4>
                <p> 	
                In this study we defined five classes of land cover that characterize the 
				urban form of Addis Ababa: Artificial surface cover, high vegetation, 
				low vegetation, soil and water. 
                Multitemporal remotely sensed imagery between 1985 and 2020 was used for
                this study within the Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017).
                For each target period in a five year  interval we created spatially 
                and temporally consistent spectral- temporal metrics (STMs) derived 
                from all available Landsat-5, -7 and -8 data which served as 
                predictor variables of fraction cover. Mapping fraction cover was
                achieved through a regression based spectral unmixing approach which 
                relies on creating synthetic training data from homogenous land cover 
                pixels. This approach has been widely used in various contexts 
                including urban studies and has  shown to be very efficient and accurate 
                (Okujeni et al., 2013, Okujeni et al., 2014, Schug et al., 2018, 
                Schug et al., 2020, Cooper et al., 2020). The homogenous training data was
                sampled in an expert-based fashion relying on very-high resolution imagery 
                and the interpretation of STMs over time. After splitting the data into a
				train/test set the mapping was performed using Support Vector Regression. 
				We analysed results based on the application of the trained model on the 
				test set. 
                </p>

                In Figure 1 the population increase is depicted along with the increase 
                of artificial surfaces during the study period. Both show a similar 
                trajectory over time.

                    fractions â€“ Artificial,

                </figure>
                <p>
                The proportions of the land cover classes and their changes 
                over time are shown in Figure 2. Although artificial surfaces increased in 
                total size the proportion of artificial surfaces to the whole study area
                remains rather small. No fraction significantly increased or decreased 
                from 1985 to 2020.

				In Figure 3 model performance for each class can be derived. 
                The trained model has been  applied to the separate test set (prediction) 
                and is compared to the true values (observed). All classes
                exhibit R^2 values of 0.9 and above and RMSE values of 0.1 or smaller.
