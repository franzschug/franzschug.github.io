                Mapping urban expansion in Greater Port of Spain (Trinidad and Tobago) between 1997 and 2020
                </h3>


                <p>Tillman Schmitz & Ainka Douglas</p>

                <p class="lorem"><b><u>Introduction</u></b></p>
                
                <p>Urban expansion refers to the rapid geographical extension of agglomerations which is in part caused by rising urban populations and the increased need for housing to facilitate people. Urban expansion can affect conditions for surrounding areas putting pressure on the natural environment and biodiversity.
                The city of Port of Spain and its surrounding serve as the retail, administrative and political centre of the country of Trinidad and Tobago (Interplan 2010). During the last 40 years Greater Port of Spain, which extends into the neighbouring regional corporations of Diego Martin and San Juan/Laventille, experience an increase in population (Interplan 2010).Still, a detailed examination of land cover processes of urban expansion between the late 1990 and nowadays is missing.</p>

                <p class="lorem"><i>Research Goal:</i></p>
                
                <p class="lorem">Contribute to understanding the expansion of urban built-up areas in the city of Port of Spain</p>
                
                <p class="lorem"><i>Research Question:</i></p>
                <p class="lorem"> By how much did urban extend grow in Greater Port of Spain between 1997 and 2020?</p>
                
                <p class="lorem">For that purpose, we create land cover change maps to map urban expansion between 1997 and 2020 with the land cover classes: built-up, vegetation and water.</p>


                <p class="lorem"><b><u>Methods and Data</u></b></p>
                
                <p class="lorem"><i>Data</i></p>

                <p class="lorem">We created Landsat composite images for the years 1997 and 2020. The following table gives an overview with the corresponding images used wtihin each time frame. </p>
                

                <table style="width:90%">
                <tr>
                <th>Target year</th>
                <th>Dates</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                <td>1997</td> 
                <td>17-11-1997; 18-12-1997; 11-01-1998; 22-02-1998</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                <td>2020</td>
                <td>9-12-2019; 01-01-2020; 20-02-2020</td>
                </tr>
                </table> 
                
                <p class="lorem">The study area comprises the two regions Port of Spain and San Juan–Laventille, where big urban agglomerations are located. </p>

                <p class="lorem"><i>Methods</i></p>

                <p class="lorem">To create the land cover change maps, we used the approach of post-classification change detection, where first two land cover maps are produced independently. Then a land cover change map is created. The random forest (RF) algorithm is used to produce the land cover maps. The RF classifier is an ensemble classifier that uses a set of classification trees (CART) to make a prediction. Essentially, the classifier learns characteristics of the target class from training samples and identifies these characteristics in unclassified data. Training and validation data will be derived via GoogleEarth data from 1997 and 2020. </p>

                <p class="lorem">Overall Accuracy: 67.2%</p>

                <p class="lorem"><b><u>Conclusion</u></b></p>
                As a small nation, Trinidad and Tobago only has only a single official area that is considered a “city,” this is the country’s capital of Port of Spain. Thus, Port of Spain and its environs is one of the most densely populated areas on the island. In 1997, Trinidad and Tobago had a population of approximately 1.26 million however, in 2020 current demographic data suggests the island has closer to 1.4 million individuals. 
                
                As expected, there has been an increase in urban areas due to an increase in population in the Port of Spain area. According to our map, the areas in which the population is highest and consequently, the areas where the urban population has expanded the most are highlighted in red. These areas where urban expansion is greatest include Diego Martin, Belmont/ East Downtown Port of Spain, Point Cumana, Carenage and Chaguaramas.
